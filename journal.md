# Title
A preliminary investigation into Jeff's obsession with cheese and fear of sheep.

# Introduction
This is an investigation into why Jeff is:
1) such an idiot
2) loves cheese
3) is mortally scared of sheep
Fluffy et al already investigated this idiot but they got confused and left him too it. 
Of course Alan has already tried to calm down Jeff, but he got all excited as he had a fridge to sell and completely forgot.
We've also caught Jeff rubbing cheese in places you were don't want your cheese to be rubbed in. 
We must not talk about Gregg. 

Methodology 
We observed and recorded the quantity of cheese in the fridge over 7 days and noted the differences in volumes.

Conclusions
Jeff is an idiot who eats far too much cheese.
